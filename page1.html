                    What kind of advertising do you offer on Instagram?</strong><br>We have several different advertising stratgeies that you can choose from. You can receive a simple shoutout with a "follow @yourusername," you can promote a product or service on our story or as a post (24 hrs), you can customize our bio (including any product/service links you'd like) for an entire week, etc. Each option has slightly different pricing, so please send us a DM or email livesoflords@gmail.com for more details.<br><br><strong>Who created the eBooks and penny stock courses?</strong><br>The eBooks and courses were all created by the same person, the creator of the @livesolords page. He has an extensive knowledge of technology, business, the stock market, etc. The eBook titled "Master the Market: Day Trading Simplified" has several screenshots showcasing some of his success in the stock market and we can send you a preview of our courses, showing credibility, if you request it through email.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do I need to have past knowledge of stocks before buying the courses?</strong><br>Absoluteley not. Our courses are designed to be completely "beginner-friendly," especially Vol. I. However, if you have no prior knowledege, it's recommended you complete "Master the Market: Vol. I" before "Master the Market: Vol. II," which is why buying them in the bundle package with the 25% discount is recommended.<br><br><strong>How long does access to the courses last?</strong><br>A lifetime! Once you enroll in the course, you'll have access forever! That includes any updates or adjustments made to the courses that your enroll in!<br><br><br><strong>How much money do I need to start trading penny stocks?</strong><br>There is no set amount of money required, but I recommend at least $2,000. If you don't have that much yet, you still absolutely start trading and find success, but things can become slightly more difficult when you have very little wiggle room (below $1,000).</h3>
